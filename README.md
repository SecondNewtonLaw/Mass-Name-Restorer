# Mass-Name-Restorer

Mass name restorer is a Discord bot, that, based on Regular Patterns, or in a simple text, it verifies if the regex matches, and if it does, resets the users' user name back to default, in case Regex is not passed, the bot will check the usernames to see if they contain the text, if so, it will reset them.

How to set-up:

- Edit Main.cs `srId` variable to have your servers' id
- Create a file called `token.IGNORE` in the folder where the application will be executed, and copy-paste the token in it
- Run the executable.
- Make the bot build commands typing (After it signs in) `buildcommand`, and wait for completition.
